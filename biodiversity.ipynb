    "\n",
    "This Biodiversity in National Parks Project aims to analyze multiple data sources to determine patterns and relationships between species conservation status and their sightings at major national parks in the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will scope, analyze, plot, and evaluate the data to provide information necessary to answer the questions below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the distribution of conservation status across species?\n",
    "2. Are certain species more likely to face endangerment than others?\n",
    "3. Is there a significant difference between species and their conservation status?\n",
    "4. What animal, if any, appears to be closest to facing exctinction at this time? What is it's distribution across parks?\n",
    "5. Is there an animal that is more prevelant than others? Does this prevelance differ across parks?\n",
    " \n",
    "Upon answering these questions, this project will address potential issues with the data and findings, as well as open discussion for improvements and future questions that can be answered with further data collection and analysis.\n",
