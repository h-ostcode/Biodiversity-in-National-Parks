# Biodiversity in National Parks

## Description

The Biodiversity in National Parks Portfolio Project is in response to the Data Science Foundations Unit of the Codecademy Data Science: Machine Learning Career Path. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate capability and skill with data wrangling, tidying, visualizing, and analyzation with two provided datasets.

### Files

The following files are included with this project:

* `biodiverstiy.ipynb`: a Juptyer Notebook file containing project outline, coded data analysis, visualizations, and conclusions
* `observations.csv`: a `.csv` file containing the species obervational data from four of the United States' national parks
* `species_info.csv`: a `.csv` file containing the detailed species information for species observerd in `observations.csv`
* visualizations: a folder containing the visualizations generated in `biodiverstiy.ipynb` during analysis:
   
   * `bat_obs.png`, `hawk_obs.png`, `percent_protected.png`, `protection_category.png`, `shrew_obs.png`, `sparrow_obs.png`, `species_conservation.png`, `warbler_obs.png`, and `wolf_obs.png`

### Languages, Libraries, and Modules

* Python:

   * pandas
   * numpy
   * matplotlib
   * seaborn
   * scipy
   * itertools
   * string
   
## Goals

1. Inspect and clean each dataset
2. Analyze, visualize, and compare conservation status distributions
3. Subset data to determine species frequency by conservation status
4. Combine the two `.csv` files into single DataFrame
5. Analyze how observations across parks correlate to animal conservation status
6. Develop key insights from current data regarding conservation efforts of national parks
7. Address potential project limitations and opportunities for further expansion
